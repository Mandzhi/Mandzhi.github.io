### Main Projects 
**[Data-driven applications for wind energy analysis and prediction: The case of “La Haute Borne” wind farm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772508122000382)**

In this project, the potential of LSTM usage for wind power forecasting was investigated.

**[Practical aspects of absolute permeability finding for the lattice Boltzmann method and pore network modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437121005227)**

The paper investigates practical aspects of two methods for estimating absolute permeability: lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and pore network modeling. Some of the image processing processes were done using Python libraries.
