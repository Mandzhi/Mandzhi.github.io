[Practical aspects of absolute permeability finding for the lattice Boltzmann method and pore network modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437121005227)

The paper investigates practical aspects of two methods for estimating absolute permeability: lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and pore network modeling. Some of the image processing processes were done using Python libraries.
